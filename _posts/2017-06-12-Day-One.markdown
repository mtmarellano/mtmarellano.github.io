Thankfully we were able to donate a full bag of unopened groceries to a food drive at work and a bag of opened groceries to my parents. Spent the day meal planning and shopping.

It hasnâ€™t been easy. Amazing how just without one day I can already tell how addicted I am to sugar. 
It was awesome talking to people at work and finding out that some of them had great success with this. Just stay with it.
