AM:
The less I focus on food, the better. When I’m busy, I don’t think about it. I woke up feeling sluggish and had a bit of a headache after eating my monkey salad bowl for breakfast. But then I had my coffee and worked for 2 hours straight and felt fine.

PM: 
Today was kind of rough. Dinner was shepherd’s Pie, all compliant. It can definitely use some work but it was pretty tasty all things considered.
